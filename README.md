# Big Book of AWS
Miscellaneous Notes for my consumption about AWS

# Why?
I collect a lot of info about AWS, through newsletters, reading, blogs, etc. A lot of of it gets saved into random folders on whichever computer I'm using at the time,
OneNote documents that I can't find, bookmarks that I never look at etc. This is an attempt to try and organise it into something resembling a repository of information
for both my personal but also the broader community's use.
